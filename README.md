# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help Maria and her supervisor to collect basic
information of different schools in different districts. It includes information
of different students' school, school district, math score, reading score and so on.
By first collecting these information, we can then calculate the average of math score,
reading score of different schools. By analyzing these information, its useful in
many ways. For example, finding the highest-performing based on the overall
percentage of passing students will help the district determine how much money
should be allocated to and spent on each school. Moreover, we are finishing these
work by using the jupyter notebook with python3, which will also help us to
get more familiar with using the pandas series and data frame by importing data
from the excel.

### Purpose
By doing this analysis, we are able to clearly see the different information of
students scores in different schools.And we can use the results we get to analyze
the education improvement in different districts and schools.

## Election-Audit Summary

This script can be used to verify the result of county votes and candidate votes.
Since most election is doing the work of counting votes, therefore, we can simply
change the .csv file of reading and also create a new txt file of writing the
result. However, reading the csv file is kind of hard coded, because we know
the position of each county and candidate, but we can later to first open the .CSV
file but automatically search for the correct names for each part will be perfect.
for example, we can read through a new csv file to first find titles and save
the titles and count the total number for each title. therefore, we can easily
open a new csv file in any other election csv file.
Moreover, the print and writing of the script is also hardcoded, we can modifiy
it by changing the name for example county in the script to a saved variable Which
we have saved the name when we are trying yo read through the csv file.
